# Python-Team-Project
Your programshould:

•Prompt the user for the name of a color PNG image file, complete the processing, then save the various processed images to .pngoutput files. Use matplotlib to read the image file, as well as export  it  back  as .png.  Implement  your  image  processing  algorithms  usingonly  the numpylibrary. 

•Conduct error checkingon inputs, inform the user if they enter an incorrect filename, then ask the user to re-enter proper inputs or exit appropriately.

•Convert color PNG image to grayscale using an appropriate standard. Your program should onlyuse numpyfunctions and save the converted image as a .pngimage. 

•Perform edge detection usingthe steps belowand output the processed image as a .pngimageafter each step (see Figure 2)using only the numpylibrary:oEdge blurring/noise smoothingoEdge enhancement –high pass filteringoThresholding (edge detection)

•Output  image  of  the  image  with  edge  detection  highlighted.    This  file  should  be  a  png  format viewable in web browser window. 

****Utilize function(s) in this project to allow for modularity and reusability. This will also allow your project team to assign each group member with a specific task, and the member will individually work on their task and build their user-defined function, that accepts inputs they need and return the desired output
